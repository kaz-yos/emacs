;;; Commentary:
;;
;; M-x `open-junk-file' opens a new file whose filename is derived from
;; current time. You can write short program in it. It helps to
;; try-and-error programs.
;;
;; For example, in Emacs Lisp programming, use M-x `open-junk-file'
;; instead of *scratch* buffer. The junk code is SEARCHABLE.
;;
;; In Ruby programming, use M-x `open-junk-file' and
;; write a script with xmpfilter annotations. It is the FASTEST
;; methodology to try Ruby methods, Irb is not needed anymore.
;; Xmpfilter is available at http://eigenclass.org/hiki/rcodetools

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `open-junk-file'
;;    Open a new file whose filename is derived from current time.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `open-junk-file-format'
;;    *File format to put junk files with directory.
;;    default = "~/junk/%Y/%m/%d-%H%M%S."
;;  `open-junk-file-find-file-function'
;;    *Function to open junk files.
;;    default = (quote find-file-other-window)

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put open-junk-file.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'open-junk-file)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET open-junk-file RET
;;


;;; Bug Report:
;;
;; If you have problem, send a bug report via M-x open-junk-file-send-bug-report.
;; The step is:
;;  0) Setup mail in Emacs, the easiest way is:
;;       (setq user-mail-address "your@mail.address")
;;       (setq user-full-name "Your Full Name")
;;       (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "your.smtp.server.jp")
;;       (setq mail-user-agent 'message-user-agent)
;;       (setq message-send-mail-function 'message-smtpmail-send-it)
;;  1) Be sure to use the LATEST version of open-junk-file.el.
;;  2) Enable debugger. M-x toggle-debug-on-error or (setq debug-on-error t)
;;  3) Use Lisp version instead of compiled one: (load "open-junk-file.el")
;;  4) Do it!
;;  5) If you got an error, please do not close *Backtrace* buffer.
;;  6) M-x open-junk-file-send-bug-report and M-x insert-buffer *Backtrace*
;;  7) Describe the bug using a precise recipe.
;;  8) Type C-c C-c to send.
;;  # If you are a Japanese, please write in Japanese:-)

;; Revision 1.3  2010/06/18 20:07:49  rubikitch
;; Rename variable: `open-junk-file-directory' -> `open-junk-file-format'
;; `open-junk-file-directory' is an alias now, so you do not have to modify your .emacs.
;;
;; Revision 1.2  2010/05/04 09:08:48  rubikitch
;; Added bug report command
